How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Because it shows the last changes made in the files, so I can easily check what data was changed.
We can focus on what is more probable to have an error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can watch all the changes made to that code in an instant and review the changes in many periods of time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit like you do in Git vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?
Well, I think that it is because if it is save automatically it could contains errors and also it cannot include completed features.

Why do you think come version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file separately?

Because of the content of the files, in one part it is supposed that the files are not related, so if you change a file that doesn't affect others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Well, the git log shows all the commits made through a period of time and
with git diff we can check the differences between two commits and what files
were modified and which lines were addded or deleted


How might using a version control make you more confident to make changes
that could break something?
Well, that gives me confidence because I can return to a version where it works well.


Now that you have your workspace set up what do you want to try using for Git?
Maybe modify some files in a project to see how git works.
