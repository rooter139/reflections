New reflections about GitHub

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I believe that it is useful when I work in a team, so in that case everyone can work remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I could have two versions probably a beta version with the latest features and other stable, and also I need to test the changes before made them public.
There could be errors in the process and upload some changes that I don't mean.
