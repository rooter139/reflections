New reflections about GitHub

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I believe that it is useful when I work in a team, so in that case everyone can work remotely

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I could have two versions probably a beta version with the latest features and other stable, and also I need to test the changes before made them public.
There could be errors in the process and upload some changes that I don't mean.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is the name of a tool that is use to clone a repository in GitHub.

Clone is a command that let you get a copy of a repository.

Branch is a part of a repository that is used to work on features without affect the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It is used to have the repository up-to-date, because the code can have many changes if we wait alog period of time to update.
